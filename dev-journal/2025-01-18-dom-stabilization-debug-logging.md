# DOM Stabilization Debug Logging Enhancement

## Overview

Added comprehensive debug logging to identify why DOM stabilization never completes. The enhanced logging will help pinpoint exactly what's preventing the page from being considered stable.

## Enhanced Logging Features

### 1. Detailed Stability Reasons

- Shows specific reasons why DOM is unstable with counts
- Examples: "document not ready (loading)", "network activity (2 pending)", "loading elements (1 found)"

### 2. Network Tracking Visibility

- Logs when network tracking is initialized
- Shows current pending request counts
- Tracks fetch/XHR start and completion in page console

### 3. Debug Information Structure

```typescript
debugInfo: {
    pendingRequestsCount: number,
    networkTrackingInitialized: boolean,
    documentReadyState: string,
    loadingElementsCount: number,
    disabledElementsCount: number,
    commonLoadingClassesCount: number,
    overlayElementsCount: number
}
```

### 4. Rate-Limited Detailed Logging

- Unstable reasons logged every check (50ms intervals)
- Detailed debug info only every 500ms to avoid console spam
- Final stability state logged when stable

### 5. Timeout Logging

- Shows exact timing when operations timeout
- Differentiates between network vs non-network timeouts

## Expected Debug Output

**When DOM is unstable:**

```
🔄 DEBUG: DOM unstable after 150ms. Reasons: network activity (1 pending), loading elements (2 found)
🔍 DEBUG: Network tracking initialized: true
🔍 DEBUG: Detailed debug info: { pendingRequestsCount: 1, networkTrackingInitialized: true, ... }
```

**When DOM stabilizes:**

```
✅ DEBUG: DOM stabilized after 1200ms
🔍 DEBUG: Final stability state: { pendingRequestsCount: 0, networkTrackingInitialized: true, ... }
```

**Network tracking:**

```
🔗 DEBUG: Initializing network tracking for tab 123
✅ DEBUG: Network tracking initialization completed for tab 123
🌐 DEBUG: Fetch started, pending requests: 1
🌐 DEBUG: Fetch completed, pending requests: 0
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

Common issues this will help identify:

1. **Infinite network requests** - Will show pendingRequestsCount never reaching 0
2. **Persistent loading elements** - Will show loadingElementsCount > 0 with specific counts
3. **Continuous animations** - Will show "animations running" reason
4. **Document not ready** - Will show documentReadyState value
5. **Network tracking not initialized** - Will show networkTrackingInitialized: false

## Next Steps

Run the agent with these enhanced logs to identify the specific cause of instability and implement targeted fixes.
