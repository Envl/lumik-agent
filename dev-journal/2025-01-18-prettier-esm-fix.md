# ESM Prettier Configuration Fix

## Issue

Encountered an ESM compatibility error when using Prettier with the Tailwind CSS plugin:

```
require() cannot be used on an ESM graph with top-level await. Use import() instead.
```

## Root Cause

The project uses ESM (`"type": "module"` in package.json) but the Prettier configuration was in JSON format (`.prettierrc`), which was causing compatibility issues with the `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` plugin when it tried to load in the ESM environment.

## Solution

1. **Converted Prettier configuration to ESM format**: Created `prettier.config.js` as an ES module
2. **Removed old configuration**: Deleted the `.prettierrc` file to avoid conflicts
3. **Plugin order adjustment**: Put `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` before `prettier-plugin-svelte` in the plugins array
4. **Added VS Code settings**: Created `.vscode/settings.json` to ensure proper integration

## Configuration Files Created/Modified

- `prettier.config.js` - New ESM-compatible Prettier configuration
- `.vscode/settings.json` - VS Code workspace settings for Prettier integration
- Removed `.prettierrc` - Old JSON configuration file

## Testing

- ✅ Prettier now works without ESM errors
- ✅ TypeScript files format correctly
- ✅ Svelte files format correctly with both plugins
- ✅ Tailwind CSS classes are properly sorted

## Technical Details

The key was moving from a JSON configuration to a JavaScript ES module configuration that's compatible with the project's ESM setup. The plugins are now loaded properly without the CommonJS/ESM compatibility issues.
