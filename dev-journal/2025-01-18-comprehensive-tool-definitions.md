# Comprehensive Tool Definitions Enhancement

## Problem Identified

The agent was taking too many steps to complete simple tasks like "navigate to youtube tab" because the tool definitions were vague and didn't provide clear guidance on:

- What arguments each tool expects
- When to use each tool
- Expected argument formats and types
- Tool usage patterns and workflows

## Previous Tool Definitions (Vague)

```typescript
tabs_switch: 'Switch to tab. Args: tabId or url pattern'
tabs_list: 'List all open tabs with their titles and URLs'
dom_click: 'Clicks on an element. Args: elementId'
```

## Enhanced Tool Definitions (Comprehensive)

```typescript
tabs_switch: 'Switch to a different tab by ID or URL pattern. Args: {tabId?: number, url?: string} - Use tabId from tabs_list OR url pattern to match (e.g., "youtube")'
tabs_list: 'Get list of all open tabs with their IDs, titles, and URLs. Returns array of tab objects. No arguments required. Args: {}'
dom_click: 'Clicks on a specific element on the page. Use this after scanning page to get element IDs. Args: {elementId: string} - The elementId from page scan results (e.g., "llm-5")'
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Detailed Argument Specifications

- **Before**: `Args: tabId or url pattern`
- **After**: `Args: {tabId?: number, url?: string} - Use tabId from tabs_list OR url pattern to match (e.g., "youtube")`

### 2. Usage Context and Dependencies

- Added "Use this after scanning page" for DOM tools
- Added "Use tabId from tabs_list" for tab switching
- Added "No arguments required" for parameter-less tools

### 3. Categorical Organization

```typescript
// DOM Tools - For interacting with page elements
// Navigation Tools - For changing page/URL
// Tab Management - For working with browser tabs
// Browser APIs - For downloads and storage
// Page Analysis - For understanding page content
// Meta Tools - For task management and user interaction
```

### 4. Enhanced System Prompt

Added specific usage patterns and workflows:

```
TOOL USAGE PATTERNS:
- Tab switching: tabs_list → tabs_switch (with tabId or url pattern)
- Page interaction: page_scan → dom_click/dom_type/etc (with elementId)
- Navigation: navigate_to (with full URL)
- Task completion: task_complete (with success message)
```

### 5. Concrete Examples

Provided specific examples for common operations:

- Tab switching by ID: `{"tabId": 123}`
- Tab switching by URL: `{"url": "youtube"}`
- Element clicking: `{"elementId": "llm-5"}`

### 6. Better Result Formatting

Enhanced the action result context to provide more specific information:

```typescript
if (result.tabs) {
    resultText = `Found ${result.tabs.length} tabs: ${result.tabs.map((t: any) => `"${t.title}" (${t.url})`).join(', ')}`
} else if (result.pageInfo) {
    resultText = `Page info: "${result.pageInfo.title}" at ${result.pageInfo.url}`
} else if (result.tabId) {
    resultText = `Created new tab with ID: ${result.tabId}`
}
```

### 7. Removed Unimplemented Tools

- Removed `dom_wait` (not implemented)
- Removed `take_screenshot` (not implemented)

## Expected Impact

This should significantly reduce the number of steps needed for common tasks by:

1. **Clearer Decision Making**: LLM knows exactly what arguments each tool expects
2. **Better Workflows**: Explicit patterns like "tabs_list → tabs_switch"
3. **Reduced Ambiguity**: Clear distinction between tabId (number) and url (string pattern)
4. **Better Context**: Enhanced result formatting provides more actionable information for next steps

## Test Case

For "navigate to youtube tab" command, the agent should now:

1. Call `tabs_list` to get available tabs
2. See the result with tab IDs and URLs
3. Call `tabs_switch` with `{"url": "youtube"}` to match the URL pattern
4. Complete with `task_complete`

This should reduce the typical 6-10 step process to just 2-3 steps.

## Status

✅ Comprehensive tool definitions implemented
✅ Enhanced system prompt with usage patterns
✅ Improved result formatting for better context
✅ Compiled successfully
⏳ Ready for testing to verify step reduction
