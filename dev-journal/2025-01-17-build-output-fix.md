# Dev Journal - January 17, 2025 - Build Output Structure Fix

## Problem

The Vite build was outputting the sidebar HTML file as `dist/src/sidebar/index.html` instead of `dist/sidebar.html`, which caused the Chrome extension to not load the sidebar properly since the manifest.json was referencing `sidebar.html` in the root of the dist folder.

## Solution

1. **Updated Vite Configuration**: Modified the Rollup input to use `sidebar` as the key for the HTML file
2. **Updated manifest.json**: Changed the `side_panel.default_path` from `"index.html"` to `"sidebar.html"`
3. **Added Post-Build Script**: Created `post-build.js` to move and rename the HTML file from the nested directory structure to the root of the dist folder
4. **Updated package.json**: Modified the build script to run the post-build script after Vite build

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:

- `vite.config.ts` - Changed input key from `index` to `sidebar`
- `manifest.json` - Updated `side_panel.default_path` to `"sidebar.html"`
- `package.json` - Updated build script to include post-build step
- `post-build.js` - New file to handle HTML file relocation

### Build Output Structure:

```
dist/
├── background.js
├── scanner.js
├── sidebar.js
├── sidebar.css
├── sidebar.html          # ← Now in root (was dist/src/sidebar/index.html)
├── manifest.json
└── icons/
    ├── icon16.png
    ├── icon48.png
    └── icon128.png
```

## Verification

- ✅ Build passes with no errors
- ✅ TypeScript checking passes
- ✅ `sidebar.html` is now in the root of the dist folder
- ✅ HTML file contains correct references to JS and CSS files (`/sidebar.js` and `/sidebar.css`)
- ✅ Manifest.json correctly references `sidebar.html`

## Next Steps

- Load the extension in Chrome to verify it works correctly
- Test that the sidebar opens and functions properly
- Consider adding a dev mode that doesn't need the post-build step

## Follow-up Fix: Svelte 5 Mount API

### Issue
After initial build, encountered a Svelte 5 error: `Uncaught Error: https://svelte.dev/e/effect_orphan` when loading the extension. This was due to using the old Svelte 4 mount syntax with Svelte 5.

### Solution
1. **Updated main.ts**: Changed from `new App({ target: ... })` to `mount(App, { target: ... })`
2. **Fixed file naming**: Renamed `thinking-Indicator.svelte` to `thinking-indicator.svelte` to follow kebab-case convention
3. **Updated imports**: Fixed the import in `chat-container.svelte` to use the corrected filename

### Changes Made
- `src/sidebar/main.ts` - Updated to use Svelte 5 mount API
- `src/sidebar/components/thinking-Indicator.svelte` → `thinking-indicator.svelte`
- `src/sidebar/components/chat-container.svelte` - Fixed import path

### Verification
- ✅ Build passes with no errors
- ✅ TypeScript checking passes
- ✅ Svelte 5 mount API properly implemented
- ✅ File naming follows kebab-case convention

## Side Panel Position Inquiry

### Issue
User requested to change the sidebar to open on the right side instead of the left side.

### Investigation
After researching the Chrome Side Panel API, it was determined that:
- **Extension cannot control side panel position** - this is controlled by user's Chrome browser settings
- The side panel position (left or right) is a user preference setting in Chrome
- Chrome's official documentation confirms: "Within Chrome's settings, users can specify which side the panel should be displayed on"

### Solution
- **For Users**: Navigate to Chrome settings → Appearance → Side panel position to change from left to right
- **For Extension**: Ensure responsive design works well on both left and right sides
- **Documentation**: Could add user instructions about changing side panel position in Chrome settings

### References
- Chrome Side Panel API: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sidePanel
- Position is user-controlled, not extension-controlled
