# Task Planning Implementation

## Date: 2025-01-18

## Problem

The agent loop needed better task planning capabilities to provide context to the LLM about the overall task strategy before executing individual actions.

## Solution

Implemented intelligent task planning functionality that:

1. **Uses LLM to generate task plans**:
    - Modified `buildTaskPlan()` to use `llmBridge.makeRequest()` for intelligent plan generation
    - Provides comprehensive context including user command, page context, and available tools
    - Generates detailed markdown-formatted plans with analysis and strategy

2. **Integrates plan into system prompt**:
    - Modified `buildSystemPrompt()` to include the task plan when available
    - Provides LLM with context about the overall task strategy
    - Helps guide decision-making throughout the execution

3. **Handles edge cases gracefully**:
    - Fallback to simple plan if LLM is not configured
    - Error handling with fallback plan if LLM request fails
    - Clears `taskPlan` when agent loop completes or aborts

## Implementation Details

### LLM-Generated Task Plan Structure

The planning prompt now generates structured plans with:

1. **Primary Objective**: Clear, single-sentence goal statement
2. **Success Criteria**: Specific, measurable outcomes and validation checkpoints
3. **Execution Strategy**: 3-7 actionable steps with:
    - Specific actions to take
    - Expected outcomes
    - Required tools
    - Validation methods
4. **Risk Assessment**: Potential failure points and alternatives
5. **Validation Plan**: How to confirm success and handle failures

### Enhanced Planning Prompt

The LLM receives comprehensive context including:

- User command analysis
- Current page context (URL, title, elements, page type)
- Available tools list
- Structured requirements for actionable plans
- Clear formatting guidelines for consistency

### Integration Points

- `buildTaskPlan()`: Uses LLM to create intelligent plans
- `buildSystemPrompt()`: Includes plan in LLM context
- `agentLoop()`: Plan creation, usage, and cleanup

### Error Handling

- Fallback to simple plan if LLM not configured
- Fallback to basic plan if LLM request fails
- Plan is cleared in finally block to ensure cleanup
- Debug logging for plan creation and cleanup

## Benefits

- Intelligent, context-aware task planning
- Better strategic guidance for complex tasks
- Detailed analysis of user commands and page context
- Improved task completion rates through better planning
- Clean separation between planning and execution phases
