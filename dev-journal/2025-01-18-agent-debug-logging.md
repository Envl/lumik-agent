# Agent Debug Logging Enhancement

## Context

After fixing the infinite loop issue, the agent now successfully completes tasks but sometimes takes too many steps. To better understand the decision-making process and optimize performance, comprehensive debug logging has been added.

## Debug Features Added

### 1. Agent Loop Progress Tracking

- Step counter with progress indicators
- Loop start/end logging with command context
- Clear step boundaries in console output

### 2. Full LLM Prompt Logging

Added detailed logging of the complete prompt sent to the LLM:

```typescript
console.log('🔍 DEBUG: Full LLM Prompt')
console.log('==== SYSTEM PROMPT ====')
console.log(systemPrompt)
console.log('==== USER PROMPT ====')
console.log(userPrompt)
console.log('==== END PROMPT ====')
```

### 3. LLM Response Logging

Raw response from the LLM before parsing:

```typescript
console.log('🤖 DEBUG: Raw LLM Response')
console.log(response.content)
console.log('==== END RESPONSE ====')
```

### 4. Tool Execution Logging

Detailed logging of tool calls and results:

```typescript
console.log(`🔧 DEBUG: Executing tool: ${action.tool_name}`)
console.log('Tool arguments:', action.arguments)
console.log(`✅ DEBUG: Tool result for ${action.tool_name}:`)
console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2))
```

### 5. Context Summary for Each Step

Shows what information is available to the agent:

```typescript
console.log(`📝 DEBUG: Context for step ${currentStep}:`)
console.log('- Page URL:', pageContextData.url)
console.log('- Page Title:', pageContextData.title)
console.log('- Elements found:', pageContextData.elements?.length || 0)
console.log('- Recent actions:', agentState.getRecentActions().length)
console.log('- Conversation history:', conversationHistory.length, 'messages')
```

### 6. Recent Actions Analysis

Shows exactly what action history is being passed to the LLM:

```typescript
console.log('📋 DEBUG: Recent actions being sent to LLM:')
recentActions.forEach((action, index) => {
    console.log(`  ${index + 1}. ${action.action.tool_name}: ${action.action.reasoning}`)
    console.log(
        `     Result: ${action.result.success ? 'Success' : 'Error: ' + action.result.error}`
    )
})
```

### 7. Step Completion Indicators

Clear logging for different exit conditions:

- ✅ Task completed successfully
- ❓ User input required
- 💬 Agent providing response
- 🚫 Too many steps (with step count)

## Debug Symbols Used

- 🚀 Agent loop start
- 📍 Step progress
- 🔍 LLM prompt
- 🤖 LLM response
- 🔧 Tool execution
- ✅ Success/completion
- 📝 Context summary
- 📋 Action history
- ❓ User input needed
- 💬 Agent response
- ⏸️ Step pause
- 🏁 Loop completion
- 🚫 Error/limits

## Benefits

1. **Performance Analysis**: Can identify which steps are taking too long or are redundant
2. **Decision Debugging**: See exactly what context the LLM has for each decision
3. **Tool Optimization**: Identify which tools are being called unnecessarily
4. **Prompt Engineering**: Debug and optimize the system/user prompts
5. **Action Flow**: Track the complete flow of actions and their results

## Usage

All debug logs are prefixed with emoji symbols and "DEBUG:" for easy filtering. During development, these logs provide comprehensive insight into the agent's decision-making process.

## Status

✅ Debug logging implemented and compiled successfully
