# Content Script Connection Fix

## Issue
Users were experiencing a "Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist" error when trying to scan pages. This typically occurs when:

1. The content script is not properly injected into the page
2. The content script is not listening for messages
3. There's a timing issue where the background script tries to communicate before the content script is ready

## Root Cause
The background script was trying to send messages to the content script using `chrome.tabs.sendMessage()`, but the content script might not be ready or might not be injected on certain pages.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced `scanCurrentPage()` Function
- Added proper error handling for content script communication
- Added fallback mechanism to inject content script if it's not ready
- Added checks for special URLs (chrome://, chrome-extension://) that cannot be scanned
- Added retry logic with small delay after script injection

### 2. Added `ensureContentScriptReady()` Helper Function
- Pings the content script to check if it's ready
- Automatically injects the content script if ping fails
- Waits for script initialization before retrying

### 3. Enhanced Content Script Message Handler
- Added `ping` action to test content script readiness
- Improved error handling in message listener

### 4. Improved Error Messages
- More informative error messages for different failure scenarios
- Better user guidance for unsupported page types

## Files Modified
- `background.ts`: Enhanced page scanning and content script communication
- `content_scripts/scanner.ts`: Added ping handler and improved error handling

## Testing
- Build completed successfully
- Error handling now provides better feedback to users
- Content script injection fallback should resolve most connection issues

## Next Steps
- Test the fix with various page types
- Monitor for any remaining connection issues
- Consider adding more robust retry mechanisms if needed
